# DigiBakery

DigiBakery is an artisanal digital bakery, crafting the finest digital cookies in the world.

We don't mass produce our cookies in faceless factories. Instead, We bake cookies to order, one at a time.

## Backlog

The following backlog contains several bugs and features needing attention. Please resolve each item in order.

Please try not to spend more than 4 hours on this exercise. We are not looking for a perfect solution, but rather a demonstration of your ability to work with the technologies, and your approach to resolving each item.

> **IMPORTANT!** 🔥

> Please do not fork this repository. Instead, clone it to your local machine and push your changes to a new **_PRIVATE_** repository in your own GitHub account. This will allow us to review your work in isolation.

### Bug: React console warning

When visiting the Order Listing page, I see the following warning:

"Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop."

We should resolve this.

### Feature: As a bakery owner, I should be able to place a sheet with multiple cookies into an oven

Given I have an oven

When I am on the oven page

Then I should be able to prepare a batch of cookies with the same filling

When the batch of cookies is finished cooking

Then I should be able to remove the cookies into my store inventory

### Feature: cookies should actually be cooked

We lazily added to Cookie: def ready?; true; end

But, the cookies are not actually ready instantly! When a cookie is placed in the oven, we need to trigger a background cooking worker to cook the cookies and update their state after a couple minutes of "cooking"

### Feature: As a bakery owner, I should see the oven page update automatically when the cookies are ready

Given I have unfinished cookies in an oven

And I am on the oven page

Then I should see that the cookies are not yet ready

When the cookies finish cooking

Then I should see that the cookies are ready

> **Note:** This can be non-instant (e.g. performed through periodic polling is acceptable), but only the relevant part of the page should update.

### Feature: Add loading indicator for Order Listing

Given there are orders in the system

When I visit the orders page

Then I should see a loading indicator that signifies that order data is being fetched

When the data has finished loading

Then I see the order listing

### Feature: Sorting order listing table

Given there are orders in the system

When I visit the orders page

Then I should see "Order #", "Customer Name" and "Pick up at" column headers underlined, signifying that i can click on the header to sort the column

When I click on a sortable column header

Then the data in the table is reordered by that particular column in ascending order

### Feature: Marking orders fulfilled

Given there are orders in the system

When I visit the orders page

Then I should see that unfulfilled (in progress) orders have a button in the actions column called "Fulfill order".

When I click on "Fulfill order"

Then the button for that row becomes disabled

When the order has been fulfilled (by API call)
The button for that row disappears
And the order status for that row is updated

When I refresh the page
I can see that the order status still says Fulfilled
